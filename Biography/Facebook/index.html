        <div id="Ltextbox"> <p class="main"> Just after two year of joining Facebook, Nicholas left the company. He posted a Facebook status stating he was "extremely proud of the projects I worked on" and calls him time at Facebook at a high point of his career, but he is moving on and retuning to New York. He is best known for his work on the Facebook Timeline, which was influenced by his <a href="../Reports/index.html">annual reports</a>. Timeline is successful as is altered how people absorb data not just on Facebook, but also on the rest of the web. Timeline and <a href="../Daytum/index.html"> Daytum </a>, both his work follow the same pattern of the large titles, side-by-side columns.</p></div>
