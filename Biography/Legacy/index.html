    <div id="textbox2"><p class="main">When asked this question, he states that this is a difficult question. He states, "the thing I'm trying to do with my work is connect people with the footprints or data they create." Specially, he is hoping "to liberate this date". He believes that there is a massive inequality between information that services, companies, and government has access to. So he believes in the need to decrease that. He is trying to lift the curtain on the size, power, humanity, humor, and narrative potential of our data by making tools that allow people to use it. Legacy-wise, he hopes to make people more aware of data and the value it holds. Therefore, it will have impacts on service, companies, and governments so that they can effectively implement it and share it. </p> </div>
