        <div id="textbox"><p class="main"> There were signs in his childhood about were he is now. Nicholas's father was an engineer and his mother was a private chef. His mother spent most of her time raising us kids, but she did a lot of crafts. As a child, Nicholas enjoyed the book Comparisons, in which he read from cover to cover. The book contained visual accounting of the world in 200 pages of diagrams. This was the book he loved as child. At school, Nicholas always wanted to be surrounded by the creative kids. Even though he did not excel in his art courses, he continued to take them to hang out with the artistic kids. When Nicholas first got his hands on a Mac computer he was able to start making things that he didn't have the ability with his hands to produce. In high school, he learned to use Photoshop and Illustrator and designed comic books. Nicholas attended RISD and studied graphic design because he knew that's what he wanted to do.
