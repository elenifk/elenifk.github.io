        <div id="textbox"><p class="main">When Nicholas is working on his <a href="../Reports/index.html">Annual Report</a>, he gets up and goes straight to the office, eat lunch, dinner, and then comes home around 11pm or midnight. This is the only way to get his project done, since there is so much work that goes into it. Often he solves problems when he is walking to lunch or often can't sleep at night because he is thinking about how to do something. </p></div>

        <div id="textbox"><p class="main"> When Nicolas is not <a href="../Method/index.html">working</a>, he is relaxing and out exercising or going to social outings. His weekends are pretty flexible. But if he has <a href="../Legacy/index.html">a lot work</a>, it just means that he will work from home for a few hours rather than all day.
