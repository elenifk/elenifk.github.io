    <div id="textbox"><p class="main"> Cell Phone have evolved immensely since 1983, both in design and function. The first handhelp cell phone, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X was invented on March 13, 1984. It sold for $3,995. Though huge by today's standards, it was considered the first mobile phone because it was small enough to carry. Since then, technology has advanced and companies figured out how to pack all the features their customers wanted into a smaller, portable, more affordable mode. Early cellphones primarily were just for talking. The earliest smart phones let users access email, and use phone as a fax machine, pager, and address book. </p></div>

        <h1> Present</h1>
        <div id="Siri"></div> <div id="center"> <p class="main"> In recent years, the purpose of the cell phone has shifted from a verbal communication tool to a multimedia tool, often adopting the name “mobile device” rather than being called a phone at all. We now use our cell phones more for surfing the web, checking email, snapping photos, and updating our social media status than actually placing calls. The cell phones of today are also replacing our other gadgets, such as cameras and video cameras. When cameras were first introduced on phones, the images were low quality and the feature was considered to just be an extra.</p> </div>
